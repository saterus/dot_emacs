This setup is somewhat non-standard. I've got my emacs configurations and support libraries in this directory. My home directory has a symlink pointing to the apropriate files here so that I can keep things neat. I disliked making my home directory a git repo. This way, no matter how I decide to organize each computer, I can throw a symlink named .emacs in my home directory and keep this separate.
